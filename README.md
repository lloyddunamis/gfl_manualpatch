3Q) I play GFL in an iOS device. Is there a workaround for when I encounter the "Insufficient Memory" error or when the app size bloat up more than 4GB?

4Q) What do these Manual Patches contain, exactly?
4A) These Manual Patches contain files that were created/updated since the last update.

This Girls' Frontline [EN] Manual Patch was made for personal use, and it worked for me like a charm.
It is then provided to the community as-is in case it helps anyone else.
Due to differences in configurations and the like, your mileage may vary.
No warranty provided; Use at your own risk.
Though do let me know, as we might be able to fix or work around what makes it not work.
Worst case possible, you'd still have to Clear Cache/Uninstall anyway.

This is not an official product from, nor is officially endorsed by, Sunborn / MICA Team.
