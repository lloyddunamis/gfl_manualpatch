===================== A. Pre-requisites

Manual Download of Patch Files

Notes:
If you'd like to just login to the game ASAP, download only "AndroidAllData".
Features like Intelligence Center, Forward Basecamp etc., will not be accessible until you download the additional resources. You can do this while in-game though, or proceed to also download the additional resource "AndroidAddData" during the patching screen.

 [https://mega.nz/folder/nQFCTRzR#QiQcTkJq_BGY9IZMjrB1Vw]
 - AndroidData_Update[yyyy-mmdd]  (applies to either Minimal-only or FullResource)

===================== B. Instructions

Working folder:
Android\data\com.sunborn.girlsfrontline.en\files\Android\New\


MINIMAL
1) Copy Minimal(AndroidAllData) .dat file to working folder;
2) Launch GFL with FullResource download UNchecked.
3) Tap on login screen or relaunch for remaining download of Minimal updates, still with FullResource download UNchecked.
   You may now do GFL dailies that don't require the FullResource.

   (optional but eventual, should you be ready to install FullResource)
4) Copy FullResource(AndroidAddData) .dat file to working folder.
5) Relaunch GFL with FullResource download checked;
   OR while in-game, go to Settings and Download Data from there.
   Eitherway, progress should start at 90% indicating extraction process.
6) Tap on the title screen or relaunch for remaining download of FullResource updates.


FULL RESOURCE
1) Copy Minimal(AndroidAllData) & FullResource(AndroidAddData) .dat files to working folder.
2) Launch GFL with FullResource download checked.
3) Tap on the title screen or relaunch for remaining download of Minimal & FullResource updates.
   

FULL RESOURCE + MANUAL UPDATES (+ MANUAL PATCH)
1) Copy Minimal(AndroidAllData) & FullResource(AndroidAddData) .dat files to working folder.
2) Launch GFL, check FullResource download when asked.
3) Progress bar should shoot to 90%; wait for it to finish extracting the contents.
   Once done and in the title screen, exit the game or go to Home menu.
4) Extract contents of AndroidData_Update package (then all ManualPatch newer than its date if applicable, incremental from oldest to newest; overwrite) to working folder.
5) Tap on the title screen or relaunch GFL to apply updates.



===================== C. FAQ/Others

1Q) The size of GFL is increasing! (Exceeding 4GB or so)
1A) Delete the temporary downloaded files (*.dat & *.temp) left in the following game file location:

Android\data\com.sunborn.girlsfrontline.en\files\Android\New\

    iOS users will have to reinstall the game, or make the device proceed with its cleanup procedure.

2Q) Am I in the right "New" or working folder?
2A) The directory tree of the target working folder should look something like the following:

Internal storage (/storage/emulated/0)(sorted alphabetically)
- Android
  - data
    + com.app
    + com.some.app
    + com.some.other.app
    - com.sunborn.girlsfrontline.en
      + cache
      - files
        + activity
        + AIHlepSDK
        - Android
          + New        <-- This is the folder we should be working in
        + cartoon
        + il2cpp
        + stc
        + Unity
        + UnityCache
    + com.yet.another.app
  + obb

3Q) I play GFL in an iOS device. Is there a workaround for when I encounter the "Insufficient Memory" error or when the app size bloat up more than 4GB?
3A) Unfortunatley there is no known workaround for iOS devices. You will have to repeatedly Clear Cache in-game after several attempts of patching.

4Q) What do these Manual Patches contain, exactly?
4A) These Manual Patches contain the .dat files that the client downloads itself, and that were created/updated since the last update.

{will add more when needed}

This Girls' Frontline [EN] Manual Patch was made for personal use, and it worked for me like a charm.
It is then provided to the community as-is in case it helps anyone else.
Due to differences in configurations and the like, your mileage may vary.
No warranty provided; Use at your own risk.
Though do let me know, as we might be able to fix or work around what makes it not work.
Worst case possible, you'd still have to Clear Cache/Uninstall anyway.

This is not an official product from, nor is officially endorsed by, Sunborn / MICA Team.
