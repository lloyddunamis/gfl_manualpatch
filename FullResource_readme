===================== A. Pre-requisites

Manual Download of Patch Files

Notes:
If you'd like to just login to the game ASAP, download only "AndroidAllData".
Features like Intelligence Center, Forward Basecamp etc., will not be accessible until you download the additional resources. You can do this while in-game though, or proceed to also download the additional resource "AndroidAddData" during the patching screen.

Default  (for fresh installs, or clear cache without Voodoo recipe flag)

(Optional but quickens client patching further/lowers the chance to stumble upon the dreaded "Insufficient Memory" or 99% progress halt)
Manual Update Patches: (update files that are downloaded after Minimal or FullResource is installed)
 [https://mega.nz/folder/nQFCTRzR#QiQcTkJq_BGY9IZMjrB1Vw]
 - MinimalUpdate[yyyy-mmdd]
 - FullResourceUpdate[yyyy-mmdd]
 - ManualPatch[yyyy-mmdd]  (deploy when its date is newer than MinimalUpdate or FullResourceUpdate; extract from oldest to newest)


===================== B. Instructions

These are attempts to give instructions on different levels. An "In other words" kind of concept.

Working folder for all instances:
Android\data\com.sunborn.girlsfrontline.en\files\Android\New\


=========== a. Straightforward

MINIMAL
1) Copy Minimal(AndroidAllData) .dat file to working folder;
2) Launch GFL with FullResource download UNchecked.
3) Tap on login screen or relaunch for remaining download of Minimal updates, still with FullResource download UNchecked.
   You may now do GFL dailies, that doesn't require the FullResource.

   (optional but eventual, towards a full resource installation)
4) Copy FullResource(AndroidAddData) .dat file to working folder.
5) Relaunch GFL with FullResource download checked;
   OR while in-game, go to Settings and Download Data from there.
6) Relaunch GFL for remaining download of FullResource updates.


FULL RESOURCE
1) Copy Minimal(AndroidAllData) & FullResource(AndroidAddData) .dat files to working folder.
2) Launch GFL with FullResource download checked.
3) Tap on login screen or relaunch for remaining download of Minimal & FullResource updates.
   

FULL RESOURCE + MANUAL UPDATES (+ MANUAL PATCH)
1) Copy Minimal(AndroidAllData) & FullResource(AndroidAddData) .dat files to working folder.
2) Launch GFL with FullResource download checked.
3) Once in login screen or if closed,
   Extract contents of MinimalUpdate & FullResourceUpdate (then ManualPatch if applicable; overwrite) to working folder.
4) Tap on login screen or relaunch GFL to apply updates.


=========== b. Cautious  (to be updated; still old steps)

1) Extract the Minimal AndroidAllData[...].dat file to working folder.
   Copy `AndroidResConfigData.txt` to it as well.  (Important! else the client will not check for the extracted files at all)
2) Launch GFL, with FullResource download **un**checked.
   It should see the extracted files and reduce the required download size from 986MB down to around 315MB.
3) **Copy** Additional AndroidAddData[...].dat to working folder.
4) Launch GFL, this time with FullResource download checked. The client will unpack the copied .dat file by itself. Close the client after it finishes, or continue playing.
   Note: You must have the correct AndroidAddData ("He_" or non-"He_"), otherwise the client will not see the wrong 1.4GB dat file.
5) Launch GFL for the last time, for the remaining update files. (currently around 155MB)


If you have the optional Manual Update Patches downloaded:
1b) Extract "MinimalUpdate[yyyy-mmdd].rar" after extracting Minimal AndroidAllData[...].dat; overwrite any existing file.
    This should reduce the required download on Step2, or skip the download entirely.
4b) Extract "FullResourceUpdate[yyyy-mmdd].rar" after the client successfully installs the contents of AndroidAddData[...].dat; overwrite any existing file.
    The client should no longer download any other file, letting you skip Step5. (unless more updates happen after the patch's date)


When the MinimalUpdate and FullResourceUpdate manual patches are older than the Manual Patches, extract each Manual Patches incrementally after extracting each of the two.
1c) After MinimalUpdate2020-1103 extraction, extract ManualPatch2020-1110 and ManualPatch2020-1117.
4c) After FullResourceUpdate2020-1103 extraction, extract ManualPatch2020-1110 and ManualPatch2020-1117.
Note: as of 2020-1117, you don't have to do this since the patches are current. Next week on 2020-1124 you will have to, if I'm unable to provide an updated MinimalUpdate2020-1124 & FullResourceUpdate2020-1124, and so on. Extract just ManualPatch2020-1124; wouldn't have to extract 2020-1117.


=========== c. For Dummies


===================== C. FAQ/Others

1Q) The size of GFL is increasing! (Exceeding 4GB or so)
1A) Delete the temporary downloaded files (*.dat & *.temp) left in the following game file location:

Android\data\com.sunborn.girlsfrontline.en\files\Android\New\

2Q) Am I in the right "New" or working folder?
2A) The directory tree of the target working folder should look something like the following:

Internal storage (/storage/emulated/0)(sorted alphabetically)
- Android
  - data
    + com.app
    + com.some.app
    + com.some.other.app
    - com.sunborn.girlsfrontline.en
      + cache
      - files
        + activity
        + AIHlepSDK
        - Android
          + New        <-- This is the folder we should be working in
        + cartoon
        + il2cpp
        + stc
        + Unity
        + UnityCache
    + com.yet.another.app
  + obb

3Q) I play GFL in an iOS device. Is there a workaround for when I encounter the "Insufficient Memory" error or when the app size bloat up more than 4GB?
3A) Unfortunatley there is no known workaround for iOS devices. You will have to repeatedly Clear Cache in-game after several attempts of patching.

4Q) What do these Manual Patches contain, exactly?
4A) These Manual Patches contain files that were created/updated since the last update.

{will add more when needed}

This Girls' Frontline [EN] Manual Patch was made for personal use, and it worked for me like a charm.
It is then provided to the community as-is in case it helps anyone else.
Due to differences in configurations and the like, your mileage may vary.
No warranty provided; Use at your own risk.
Though do let me know, as we might be able to fix or work around what makes it not work.
Worst case possible, you'd still have to Clear Cache/Uninstall anyway.

This is not an official product from, nor is officially endorsed by, Sunborn / MICA Team.
