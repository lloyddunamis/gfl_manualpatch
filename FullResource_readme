===================== A. Pre-requisites

For deployment of personal manual patch
Windows: WinRAR v5.0 or later  [https://www.rarlab.com/]
Android: RAR  [https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.rarlab.rar]


Manual Download of Patch Files

Required for all instances, the latest AndroidResConfigData.txt; retrieve from: https://mega.nz/folder/nQFCTRzR#QiQcTkJq_BGY9IZMjrB1Vw

Notes:
If you'd like to just login to the game ASAP, download only "AndroidAllData".
Features like Intelligence Center, Forward Basecamp etc., will not be accessible until you download the additional resources.
You can do this while in-game though, or proceed to also download the additional resource "AndroidAddData" during the patching screen.

(Optional but can quicken client patching further)
Manual Update Patches: (files that are downloaded after Minimal or FullResource is installed)
 [https://mega.nz/folder/nQFCTRzR#QiQcTkJq_BGY9IZMjrB1Vw]
 - MinimalUpdate[yyyy-mmdd]
 - FullResourceUpdate[yyyy-mmdd]
 - ManualPatch[yyyy-mmdd]  (Incremental patch; deploy incrementally when MinimalUpdate and FullResourceUpdate are older than ManualPatch's date)


===================== B. Instructions

Our Working folder: Android\data\com.sunborn.girlsfrontline.en\files\Android\New\

1) Extract the Minimal AndroidAllData[...].dat file to working folder.
   Copy `AndroidResConfigData.txt` to it as well.
2) Run GFL, with FullResource download **un**checked.
   It should see the extracted files and reduce the required download size from 986MB down to around 315MB.
3) **Copy** Additional AndroidAddData[...].dat to working folder.
4) Run GFL, this time with FullResource download checked. The client will unpack the copied .dat file by itself. Close the client after it finishes, or continue playing.
   Note: You must have the correct AndroidAddData ("He_" or non "He_"), otherwise the client will not see the wrong 1.4GB dat file.
5) Run GFL for the last time, for the remaining update files. (currently around 155MB)


If you have the optional Manual Update Patches downloaded:
1b) Extract "Minimal Update[yyyy-mmdd].rar" after extracting Minimal AndroidAllData[...].dat; overwrite any existing file.
4b) Extract "FullResource Update[yyyy-mmdd].rar" after the client successfully installs the contents of AndroidAddData[...].dat; overwrite any existing file.
    The client should no longer download any other file, letting you skip Step 5. (unless more updates happen after the patch's date)


When the MinimalUpdate and FullResourceUpdate manual patches are older than the Manual Patches, extract each Manual Patches incrementally after extracting each of the two.
1c) After MinimalUpdate2020-1103 extraction, extract ManualPatch2020-1110 and ManualPatch2020-1117.
4c) After FullResourceUpdate2020-1103 extraction, extract ManualPatch2020-1110 and ManualPatch2020-1117.


===================== C. Repair Archive

In case part of the archive is damaged, you may attempt to repair the file.
A damaged archive will usually fail to extract some files properly.
This archive file has a Recovery Volume for such cases.

WINDOWS
1) Open file in WinRAR (or select the file inside RAR).
2) Go to "Tools" > "Repair archive".
3) Change the output path if need be, and choose the "Treat the corrupt archive as RAR" radio button.
4) Press OK button to start repairing.
5) When finished, a new file will be created with the prefix "fixed."; this will be the repaired version of the archive file.
   Results log will also show how much damage was repaired, if any.

ANDROID
1) Open file in RAR (or select the file inside RAR).
2) Tap the vertically-aligned three dots on the top-right corner.
3) Tap "Repair archive".
4) Confirm prompt by tapping "OK".
5) When finished, a new file will be created with the prefix "fixed."; this will be the repaired version of the archive file.
   Results log will also show how much damage was repaired, if any.


Notes:
* Sometimes this works for the .dat files that are ZIP files anyway; This "rebuilds" the archive instead, somehow similar to repair.


===================== D. FAQ/Others

1Q) The size of GFL is increasing! (Exceeding 4GB or so)
1A) Delete the temporary downloaded files (*.dat & *.temp) left in the following game file location:

Android\data\com.sunborn.girlsfrontline.en\files\Android\New\

2Q) Am I in the right "New" folder?
2A) The directory tree of the target working folder should look something like the following:

Internal storage (/storage/emulated/0)
- Android
  - data
    + com.app
    + com.some.app
    + com.some.other.app
    - com.sunborn.girlsfrontline.en
      + cache
      - files
        + activity
        + AIHlepSDK
        - Android
          + New        <-- This is the folder we should be working in
        + cartoon
        + il2cpp
        + stc
        + Unity
        + UnityCache
    + com.yet.another.app
  + obb

3Q) I play GFL in an iOS device. Is there a workaround for when I encounter the "Insufficient Memory" error or when the app size bloat up more than 4GB?
3A) Unfortunatley there is no known workaround for iOS devices. You will have to repeatedly Clear Cache in-game after several attempts of patching.

This Girls' Frontline [EN] Manual Patch was made for personal use, and it worked for me like a charm.
It is then provided to the community as-is in case it helps anyone else.
Due to differences in configurations and the like, your mileage may vary.
No warranty provided; Use at your own risk.
Though do let me know, as we might be able to fix or work around what makes it not work.
Worst case possible, you'd still have to Clear Cache/Uninstall anyway.
