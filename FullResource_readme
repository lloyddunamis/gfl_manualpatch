===================== A. Pre-requisites

Manual Download of Patch Files

If you'd like to just login to the game ASAP, download only "Minimal". Features like Intelligence Center, Forward Basecamp etc., will not be accessible until you download "Additional" resources. You can do this while in-game though, or proceed to also download the "Additional" resource files during the patching screen.

https://mega.nz/folder/nQFCTRzR#QiQcTkJq_BGY9IZMjrB1Vw
 - ManualPatch_Minimal[yyyy-mmdd]  (the minimal files required to run GFL; FullResource checkbox UNchecked)
 - ManualPatch_Additional[yyyy-mmdd]  (additional files to run full GFL experience; FullResource checkbox checked)
 - ManualPatch[yyyy-mmdd]  (deploy when Minimal & Additional are dated after the _Update packages; extract all at once)
 
Note: ManualPatch package is in multi-part zip files (zip, z01, z02â€¦). Download them all to complete the whole gigabyte package.
Note for past ManualPatch users: If you're wondering where the gigabyte-large "AndroidAllData" and "AndroidAddData" are now, it seems the client has moved away from using a packaged form. All files are now downloaded directly & individually.


===================== B. Instructions

Working folder:
Android\data\com.sunborn.girlsfrontline.en\files\Android\New\


MINIMAL
1) Extract contents of Minimal.zip to working folder.
2) Launch GFL with FullResource download UNchecked.
3) Tap to proceed with the patching screen. 
   Progress bar should shoot straight to near completion.
   You may now do GFL activities that don't require the FullResource.

   (optional but eventual, once you're ready to install the FullResource)
4) Extract contents of Additional.zip to working folder.
5) Relaunch GFL with FullResource download checked;
   OR while in-game, go to Settings and Download Data from there.
   Progress bar should shoot straight to near completion.


FULL RESOURCE  (Minimal + Additional)
Note: Same as Minimal, just adding Additional.zip
1) Extract contents of Minimal.zip and Additional.zip to the working folder.
2) Launch GFL, check FullResource download when asked.
3) Tap to proceed with the patching screen.
   Progress bar should shoot straight to near completion.


Handling Multi-part ZIP files
- You need to open/extract from only the .zip file one. Your archive software should extract the rest of the numbered .z01 like it's just one big gigabyte zip file.
- Should you have only a small parts


===================== C. FAQ/Others

1Q) The size of GFL is increasing! (Exceeding 4GB or so)
1A) Delete the temporary downloaded files (*.dat & *.temp) left in the following game file location:

Android\data\com.sunborn.girlsfrontline.en\files\Android\New\

    iOS users will have to reinstall the game, or make the device proceed with its cleanup procedure (triggers by itself when storage is near full.

2Q) Am I in the right "New" or working folder?
2A) The directory tree of the target working folder should look something like the following:

Internal storage (/storage/emulated/0)(sorted alphabetically)
- Android
  - data
    + com.app
    + com.some.app
    + com.some.other.app
    - com.sunborn.girlsfrontline.en
      + cache
      - files
        + activity
        + AIHlepSDK
        - Android
          + New        <-- This is the folder we should be working in
        + cartoon
        + il2cpp
        + stc
        + Unity
        + UnityCache
    + com.yet.another.app
  + obb

3Q) I play GFL in an iOS device. Is there a workaround for when I encounter the "Insufficient Memory" error or when the app size bloat up more than 4GB?
3A) Unfortunately there is no known workaround for iOS devices. You will have to repeatedly Clear Cache in-game on every patching error encountered.

4Q) What do these Manual Patches contain, exactly?
4A) These Manual Patches contain the very files that the client downloads.
    The dated ManualPatches contain files that were created/updated/changed since the last update.

5Q) I don't like multi-part archives.
5A) I apologize for the inconvenience.
    It's been done this way for me to be able to upload them successfully at all via our derpy upto-90KB/s upload speed (throttled because we're multiple people using the internet at home),
    and to avoid possible download interruptions on the user's side that could render partial downloads of the otherwise 1.5GB file useless.

{will add more when needed}

This Girls' Frontline [EN] Manual Patch was made for personal use, and it worked for me like a charm.
It is then provided to the community as-is in case it helps anyone else.
Due to differences in configurations and the like, your mileage may vary.
No warranty provided; Use at your own risk. Though do let me know, as we might be able to fix or work around what makes it not work.
Worst case possible, you'd still have to Clear Cache/Uninstall anyway.

This is not an official product from, nor is officially endorsed by, Sunborn / MICA Team.
